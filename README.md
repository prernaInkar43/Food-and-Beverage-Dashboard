The F&B Sales Dashboard highlights a total sales figure of 53 million USD, with Takeaway being the most favored sales type. While the average transaction stood at 267 USD, the West Bengal region outperformed others. The comparison between 2017 and 2018 revealed a decline in sales, particularly in the latter year. Key ASMs, namely Priya Singh and Truan, contributed significantly. Meal preferences leaned towards dinner, followed by lunch, snacks, and breakfast. Monthly trends depicted the highest growth in January, with subsequent months showing a decline in sales expansion.
